# Hotel booking demand

## Statement of the Problem

Travelling is one of the most important and exciting things for most people. On the other hand, for the hotels, it is important for them to know when are the good seasons, what kind of people usually cancel the reservations, if there is a demand for parking space, or how many children are also staying.

In this project, we intend to give an overview of the features of the guests according to the dataset provided at:

Questions we answer:

- What is the percentage of people that travels with kids?
- When is the high, middle and low season?
- How important is to have a parking space?
- What are the features of cancelled bookings?
